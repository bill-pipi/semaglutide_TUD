**Figure 1a.**  Comparison between propensity-score matched Semaglutide and anti-obesity medications cohorts of relative hazard rates of TUD-related outcomes in patients with obesity and TUD and without T2D. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the probability of TUD-related outcomes at daily time intervals with censoring applied for a 12-month follow-up period starting from the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or anti-obesity medications during 6/2021-12/2022). Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 12-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 3a.** Comparison between propensity-score matched Semaglutide and smoking cessation medications cohorts of relative hazard rates of TUD-related outcomes in patients with obesity and TUD and without type 2 diabetes. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the probability of TUD-related outcomes at daily time intervals with censoring applied for a 12-month follow-up period starting from the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion/varenicline during 6/2021-12/2022). Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 12-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.
